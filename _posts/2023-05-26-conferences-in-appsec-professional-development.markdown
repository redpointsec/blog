# What should I look for at a Security Conference? 
_<span style="color:red">Using the upcoming conference season to get better at AppSec</span>_

Checking out conferences for the latest trends, technologies, and best practices in application security is probably something new grads or those new to the information security field have already tried to get their brains around.  These events offer a host of benefits, from Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges to informative talks and the chance of participating in "Hallway Con," a catch-all of for informal networking invaluable for career advancement and getting a wider understanding of the industry. 

As we head into the summer season with some of the industry's flagship conferences approaching ,we will discuss some of the advantages of attending security conferences for those who are just starting their journey in InfoSec.

_<span style="color:red">Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges</span>_

Security conferences often host CTF competitions, which are immersive and hands-on exercises that can simulate real-world scenarios. These challenges allow newcomers to enhance their technical skills and problem-solving abilities by tackling a range of security-related puzzles and tasks. CTFs encourage participants to use the knowledge they have of certain aspects of the industry. My first experiences with CTFs made me realize that I could solve challenges that involved research of arcane internet history (thanks, SaintCon) more readily than the technical challenges. But the technical wins delivered the more intense dopamine hits considering how it related to my goals of developing understanding in the industry. I was aware at the time of my first CTF that successful participants had made their careers happen from their puzzle-solving skills. Overall, it's a useful tool for personal advancement, but not only. Engaging in CTFs enhances one's technical prowess, but also, when done with a team, helps develop teamwork and collaboration skills.

_<span style="color:red">Informative Talks, Workshops and Villages</span>_

Security conferences feature a lineup of renowned experts who 
deliver talks and conduct workshops on diverse infosec topics. Attending these sessions provides an excellent opportunity for new members to gain insights from experienced professionals, learn about new technologies, and understand emerging threats and vulnerabilities. On the more technical side, taking advantage of the hands-on villages can be an invaluable opportunity to learn the tips and tricks that can quickly deepen your knowledge of exploits in a whole range of areas.

_<span style="color:red">"Hallway Con" - Networking or just getting to know who else is in the community or working toward similar goals</span>_ 

One of the most valuable facets of security conferences is the chance to engage in Hallway Con, the informal networking that takes place in the hallways, during breaks, and at social events. These interactions allow new infosec professionals to connect with like-minded individuals, forge meaningful relationships, and expand professional networks. Hallway Con provides a platform to exchange ideas, discuss industry trends, plan excursions into an unfamiliar city, try a local delicacy (fwd:cloudsec taught me about the pastry de r√©sistance, the Kouing Aman), seek career advice, and potentially identify mentors who can guide and support professional growth.

_<span style="color:red">Exposure to Growing Diversity in the Field</span>_

Security conferences bring together professionals from various backgrounds, industries, and expertise levels. This diverse community offers a unique opportunity for new members to gain exposure to different perspectives, approaches, and problem-solving techniques. Engaging in conversations with individuals who possess varied skill sets and experiences expands one's understanding of the multifaceted nature of information security. The ability to learn from others' viewpoints fosters innovation, adaptability, and a broader understanding of the challenges faced within the field.

Ultimately, for new members of the information security community, attending security conferences is an invaluable investment in their professional development. From participating in CTF challenges to attending talks and engaging in hallway con, these events provide a rich platform to learn, connect, and grow within the field. By honing technical skills, gaining industry insights, expanding networks, and embracing diverse perspectives, new professionals can position themselves for success and hopefully bolster their own ideas for making significant contributions to the infosec world. 

These are just a few ideas I've come up with for how I've felt I've personally benefitted from attending conferences. Let us know if you have any of your own ideas about the benefits of Security Conferences for those joining or aiming to join the security industry. And, hopefully, we can catch up at the next one.
