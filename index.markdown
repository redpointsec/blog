## Part of the Redpoint Security mission has always been aimed at helping security professionals and developers navigate the wide world of cybersecurity. Our blog points you to a few of those resources and relates our experiences working as both testers and developers. You can join on-going conversations on these topics by adding us to your bookmarks, following us on social media, or checking into Seth's weekly conversations on his [Absolute AppSec podcast](absoluteappsec.com), with live chats on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo9CDrIB0rJwG4GGz8CZEaQ).
